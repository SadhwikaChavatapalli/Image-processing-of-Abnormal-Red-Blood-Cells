# Image Classification of Abnormal Red Blood Cells

## Overview:  
This project focuses on detecting and classifying abnormal red blood cells (RBCs) using image processing and machine learning techniques. It employs the Random Forest Algorithm to identify ten types of abnormal RBCs from microscopic blood smear images, aiding in early diagnosis of blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia, elliptocytosis, and thalassemia.

### Features:  
✅ Image Preprocessing – Noise removal, contrast enhancement, and grayscale conversion.  
✅ Segmentation – Identifies RBCs using thresholding and contour detection.  
✅ Feature Extraction – Shape, size, and texture-based attributes extracted from images.  
✅ Classification – Uses Random Forest Algorithm to classify RBC abnormalities.   
✅ Results Visualization – Displays classified results with probability scores.

#### Abnormal RBC Types Detected
The system can classify the following 10 abnormal RBCs:  
Spherocyte, 
Codocyte, 
Stomatocyte, 
Ovalocyte, 
Elliptocyte, 
Degmacyte, 
Drepanocyte, 
Dacrocytes, 
Acanthocyte, 
Echinocyte 

#### Technologies Used  
Programming Language: Python  
Machine Learning Algorithm: Random Forest  
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
Dataset: RBC images collected from hospitals past patients
